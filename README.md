# Spring Microservices - REST + Microservices + Spring Boot + Spring Cloud + Docker + Kubernetes

### Our Recommendations

- Use **latest version** of Java
- Use **latest version** of "Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers" or Intellij Community Edition
- Remember: Spring Boot 3+ works only with Java 17+
